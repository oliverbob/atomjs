<br>
<p class="lead2">This is a sample page. The idea here is that it launches to a new page when a link is clicked. All codes for this functionality is located only in bootstrap.html file. When you want to call a variable from a separate file just like javascript, just create a separate javascript file for your HTML. This page is actually a sample for this concern.</p>

<div class="lead2">
	<h4>The variables below came from a separate javascript file. These are variables coming from new_page.js:</h4>
	<div id="results" style="color: #2F0A0A"></div>
